## How it works

People can buy and sell bitcoins on bitcoin exchanges.

## Get started

If you want to buy bitcoins on a bitcoin exchange, you go to the website of a bitcoin exchange, for example [coinbase](www.coinbase.com), [kraken](kraken.com) or [poloniex](poloniex.com).

Before you can start trading, you will be asked to make an account. This process should be fairly self-explanatory and they are generally willing to offer help if you don't understand what you should do.

In general, all bitcoin exchanges require some kind of personal identification before you can start trading. This has to do with anti-money laundering protocols imposed by governmental authorities.

If your account is all set-up, you will need to deposit some funds in your trading account. This is just sending money to the bank account of the bitcoin exchange. Don't forget to add a reference number to your payment so they can identify who paid them ;).

When you have completed this process you'll see that your account's balance is topped-up. Now you can start trading bitcoins by placing an order in the 'order-book'. To clarify, let's imagine the following (simplified) scenario:

Let's say, the bitcoin price is 800$ (this means that the last bitcoin has been bought (and sold) at 800$ on that exchange). You however would like to buy a bitcoin at 795$ because you just want it cheaper, or you think it's worth less. You create an order, stating that you want to buy 1 bitcoin at 795$. You click on submit and your order is created. Now it's time to wait. As the price tends to fluctuate, it is likely that your order will be 'filled' at some point in time. An order being filled is nothing more than a fancy way of saying that someone else created an order stating that he wanted to sell a bitcoin at 795$. The bitcoin exchange matches the orders and transfers the bitcoin from that other person to your trading account, and transfers the money to that other person.

I omitted a few things here to keep it simple. What I described above here is a way to buy bitcoins at a fixed price (limit order). Many people choose to buy at market price, which just means that you agree to buy bitcoins that are available at that moment, for a given amount of money. Hereby you start with the cheapest bitcoins that are currently available, working your way up to more expensive bitcoins until your money is up. Remember, the sell-orders come from other people who want to sell their bitcoin at that price.

You may see how a very large buy order will buy so many bitcoins at increasing prices, that the last bitcoin bought will be significantly more expensive than the first. This will have caused a higher bitcoin price. The speed at which this happens (or rather, how much money is required to cause a certain price change) is called __market resistance__. You may now also understand that exchanges with a lot of orders in the order book will have more market resistance.

## Withdrawing funds

Now you have a certain amount of bitcoins in your trading account. If you want to store the bitcoins somewhere securely, you need to transfer them to a wallet. For more info, please refer to [How should I store my bitcoins](http://www.decentral.support/questions/how-should-i-store-my-bitcoins/).


## What now?

I would like to invite you to read up on these concepts and start trading on a very small scale, just to understand how everything works. If you understand how exchanges work and how the (price-)dynamics of people buying and selling stuff works, you'll understand a lot more about economics and markets. Very valuable! It is up to you to determine to what extent you are willing to get involved with trading bitcoins. Most people [Hodl](http://www.decentral.support/glossary/HODL/).
